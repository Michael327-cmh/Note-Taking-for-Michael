# Note-Taking_App

This application allows the user to log a title for their notes as well as their notes. It will then save the notes on the left hand side of the screen for later use. 

# Future Development

The next step will be to call the existing notes so that they can be amended and saved. Furthermore, there will be an addition of a deletion function, allowing the user to get rid of an item after it has been completed.
